# validation-dedupe

**Lane E** · **Source of Truth:** SoT §4 Stages 5-6 · **Owner:** see the project board

## Purpose

Processing / To Review / Ready states, mandatory-field configuration, the Rejected-Failed view, and multi-signal duplicate detection.

## Contracts it must honour

- `packages/contracts` — endpoints, DTOs and error codes (**LAW**, G7)
- `prisma/` — schema and RLS policies (**LAW**, G7)
- `packages/validators` — deterministic validator config where this module validates

Changing any of those is a contract-change issue approved by Shakib **before** a PR opens. Code follows contracts; contracts never follow code.

## Invariants

- The Rejected/Failed view is a first-class surface, not an afterthought: every failure lands somewhere visible with a reason and a retry action.
- Every Prisma query goes through `scopedDb(ctx)` — an unscoped query is a tenancy leak (Governance §5.2).
- Money is integer pence. No floats, ever.
- Every state change creates an `ActionProposal` and executes only after a human Approve (Governance §10). No side-effect path may exist outside it.
- Zod at every boundary; external content wrapped in `<untrusted_content>` before any model sees it.
- Audit events emitted for every new state change.

## Boundaries

Exposes **only** its public providers. No other module reaches into its internals; cross-module work goes through those providers or through domain events on the transactional outbox. Import rules are lint-enforced, because this boundary is also the parallel-agent lane map.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @neoting/api test -- validation-dedupe
```

## Current state

### The document state machine (issue #80)

`document-state.ts` — **the one transition function.** The sink creates
documents in RECEIVED (creation is not a transition); every move after that
goes through `transitionDocument`, inside the CALLER's open `scopedDb`
transaction — it takes a `ScopedClient`, so it structurally cannot open a
second one (#81's executor discipline).

Five properties, each pinned by a test:

- **`LEGAL_TRANSITIONS` is a total record over `DocumentState`** — adding an
  enum value without deciding its transitions is a compile error. Every
  illegal pair (including self-transitions) throws `IllegalDocumentTransition`
  rather than silently writing; the unit suite iterates the full 8×8 matrix.
- **REJECTED and FAILED are unreachable without a code and a message in the
  type system** — `DocumentTransition` is a discriminated union whose failure
  branch requires `{ code, message }` and whose other branch carries
  `failure?: never`. A caller arriving through a cast hits the runtime guard.
- **Every transition writes a `DocumentEvent`** (stage `state`, outcome = the
  new state, the caller's traceId, detail with from/to and the failure) in the
  same transaction — the processing log is the audit surface and has no gaps.
- **The write is compare-and-swap shaped**: `updateMany` guarded on the
  expected `from` state; a lost race throws `StaleDocumentState` instead of
  clobbering a concurrent transition.
- **Failure reasons clear on reprocess, survive the archive.** REJECTED/FAILED
  → PROCESSING wipes `failureCode`/`failureMessage`; → ARCHIVED keeps them,
  because an unarchived rejection restores as a rejection and needs its reason
  back (#81's unarchive ruling). `archivedAt` stamps on the way in, clears on
  the way out.

`readiness.ts` — READY requires **Total + Supplier + Category** off the
denormalised header fields; anything missing is returned by name and the
document belongs in TO_REVIEW (`resolveProcessedState` is the one place that
choice lives). `null` and `0` pence differ on purpose — a £0.00 credit is a
confirmed value. A failed deterministic validator blocks READY with zero
missing fields. **The confidence seam is deliberately empty**: thresholds are
eval-calibrated and do not exist yet — do not invent numbers (the seam is
marked in the file header).

The Rejected/Failed surface itself is `GET /documents?state=REJECTED|FAILED`
(modules/documents, #95 — default list already excludes ARCHIVED); what this
module adds is that those states cannot be reached without a reason.
`document-state.integration.test.ts` proves the loop against a real database:
RECEIVED → PROCESSING → FAILED through the machine, then read back through the
real `DocumentsService` under RLS, reason and `retryable` hint present, event
log gapless. **Retry is a `document.reprocess` proposal on the Review →
Approve spine — no `POST /documents/{id}/retry` exists and none may** (§10).

## TODO

- [ ] Proposal executors (#81) — drive the machine from `document.route` /
      `document.archive`; the unarchive-restore ruling is recorded on #81.
- [ ] Wire the pipeline (extraction completion) onto `resolveProcessedState`
      when extraction lands; the sink still only creates RECEIVED rows today.
- [ ] Confidence gating — arrives with eval calibration, lands in the seam
      marked in `readiness.ts`. Do not invent thresholds.
- [ ] Update this file on exit — it is how the next session picks up
